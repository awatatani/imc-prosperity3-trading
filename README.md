### What is **Prosperity**?  
> Prosperity is a **15‑day, 5‑round trading competition** where you build a Python algorithm to buy and sell island‑themed products and earn as many **SeaShells** as possible.  

* Each round rolls out new products and a one‑off manual‑trading puzzle.  
* Your python algorithm must handle positions, price dynamics, and conversions to maximize profit.  
* Your overall ranking is the total SeaShells you’ve accumulated by the end of day 15.

---

## Game Mechanics

| Phase | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Simulation length** | 15 days, split into **five 72‑hour rounds** |
| **Before the timer ends** | Submit your **algorithmic bot** *and* a **manual trade**. |
| **After the deadline** | Submissions are locked in and run against Prosperity bots. |
| **Results** | When the round closes, results are revealed and the leaderboard updates. Submissions can’t be changed for closed rounds. |
| **Final standings** | After Round 5, total SeaShells determine the overall winner. |

---

## Algorithmic Trading Strategies
You have **72 hours per round** to upload your Python algorithm. The **last successfully processed submission** before the deadline is used for that round’s trading session.

### Round 1

* **Products introduced:**  
  * `RAINFOREST_RESIN` – historically stable  
  * `KELP` – regular ups & downs  
  * `SQUID_INK` – large, fast swings; rumored price pattern  

* **Position limits**
  | Product | Limit |
  |---------|------:|
  | RAINFOREST_RESIN | 50 |
  | KELP | 50 |
  | SQUID_INK | 50 |

* **Key hint:**  
  * Squid Ink’s volatility makes large open positions risky.  
  * Price spikes tend to **mean-revert**—track the deviation from a recent average and fade extreme moves for edge.

### Round 2

* **Products added:**  
  * **Composite baskets**  
    * `PICNIC_BASKET1` = 6 × `CROISSANTS` + 3 × `JAMS` + 1 × `DJEMBES`  
    * `PICNIC_BASKET2` = 4 × `CROISSANTS` + 2 × `JAMS`  
  * **Individual legs** now trade on their own orderbooks: `CROISSANTS`, `JAMS`, `DJEMBES`

* **Position limits**
  | Product | Limit |
  |---------|------:|
  | CROISSANTS | 250 |
  | JAMS | 350 |
  | DJEMBES | 60 |
  | PICNIC_BASKET1 | 60 |
  | PICNIC_BASKET2 | 100 |

### Round 3  

* **Products introduced**

  * `VOLCANIC_ROCK` – the physical underlying  
  * `Volcanic Rock Vouchers` (tradable options on the rock, all expiring in *7 trading days* at the start of Round 3):  
    | Voucher | Strike (SeaShells) |
    |---------|--------------------:|
    | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_9500  | 9 500
    | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_9750  | 9 750
    | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10000 | 10 000
    | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10250 | 10 250
    | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10500 | 10 500

* **Position limits**

  | Product | Limit |
  |---------|------:|
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK | 400 |
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_9500 | 200 |
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_9750 | 200 |
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10000 | 200 |
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10250 | 200 |
  | VOLCANIC_ROCK_VOUCHER_10500 | 200 |

* **Key hint:**  
  * Estimate implied volatility (v_t) at each timestamp using Black-Scholes, plot it against moneyness:

  ```math
  m_t = \frac{\ln\!\bigl(K / S_t\bigr)}{\sqrt{\text{TTE}}}
  ```
  * Then, fit a parabola to filter noise, and watch the time-series of the fitted at-the-money IV for trading signals across strikes.

### Round 4

* **Product introduced**  
  * `MAGNIFICENT MACARONS` – a luxury confection whose price is driven by the island’s **sunlight index**, transport costs and tariffs.  
    * Tradable **only via “conversion”** with the chef collective *Pristine Cuisine* at their posted bid/ask quotes.

* **Limits & micro-fees**  
  * **Position limit:** 75 units  
  * **Conversion limit:** 10 units per request  
  * **Storage fee:** 0.1 SeaShells *per timestamp* on **net-long** macarons (no cost when short)  
  * Each conversion pays **transport fees** plus an **import/export tariff** on top of the quoted price.

* **Hint (from the wiki)**  
  * There exists a **Critical Sunlight Index (CSI)**.  
    * **Sunlight < CSI:** panic over tight sugar & macaron supply → prices can spike far above fair value.  
    * **Sunlight ≥ CSI:** both markets drift around fair value and react to normal supply-demand flows.  
  * Detect when the sunlight index crosses CSI and position accordingly to capture the premium/discount in macaron prices.

### Round 5

## Manual Trading Strategies 
In parallel, you also have **72 hours** to place **one manual trade** each round.  
Manual and algorithmic challenges are independent, each giving you separate profit opportunities.
